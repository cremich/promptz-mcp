## Current Status

The promptz.dev MCP Server is currently in an **initial implementation** stage. The core functionality is working, allowing users to list and retrieve prompts from promptz.dev through MCP-compatible AI assistants. The server is usable for basic scenarios but lacks some advanced features and comprehensive testing.

### Development Status

- **Version**: 0.1.0
- **Stability**: Beta
- **API Compatibility**: Compatible with promptz.dev API
- **MCP Compatibility**: Compatible with MCP clients that support tools

### Implementation Progress

| Component      | Status | Notes                                     |
| -------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Core Server    | 90%    | Basic functionality complete              |
| Tool Handlers  | 80%    | Basic tools implemented                   |
| GraphQL Client | 90%    | Core queries implemented                  |
| Error Handling | 70%    | Basic error handling in place             |
| Documentation  | 60%    | Basic documentation available             |
| Testing        | 20%    | Manual testing only                       |
| Deployment     | 50%    | Basic installation instructions available |

## Known Issues

1. **Error Handling**: Some edge cases in error handling may not be properly covered, potentially leading to unclear error messages.

2. **Pagination**: The `list_prompts` tool supports pagination, but the UX for navigating through pages could be improved.

3. **API Limitations**: The server is subject to any rate limits or restrictions imposed by the promptz.dev API.

4. **Logging**: Logging is currently limited to stderr and doesn't support different log levels or configurations.

5. **Configuration**: API credentials must be provided through environment variables, which may be cumbersome for some users.

6. **Testing**: Comprehensive automated testing is not yet implemented.

## Next Milestones

1. **v0.2.0**: Improved error handling and logging

   - Estimated completion: TBD
   - Key features: Better error messages, log levels, retry logic

2. **v0.3.0**: Advanced prompt features

   - Estimated completion: TBD
   - Key features: Search, filtering, templates

3. **v1.0.0**: Production-ready release
   - Estimated completion: TBD
   - Key features: Comprehensive testing, documentation, stability improvements
